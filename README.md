"#PhotoTagger" <br>
Application enables the user to browse all the images in the selected directory and to add the tags to every single one of them. Basing on the tags, the separate directories are created for all occurring tags and images labeled with the exact same name/number are being copied there.


This solution may come in handy for companies like 
www.FotoMaraton.pl and for private users as well. It greatly simplifies the sharing process. Do you have lots of images and you don't think putting them all in cloud so everyone can see everything is the best idea? Sorting them "by hand" sounds like nothing but boring work? Just use this app to go through them all, tag them with the unique names, e.g. trip name (Italy, Tatras, etc.) or your friends'/family membersâ€™/dog's name and at the end export them and send different sets of pictures to them!

Main Java features used in the project:<br>
*FavaFX (SceneBuilder)<br>
*Collections<br>
*Lambda expressions<br>
*REGEX, Pattern, Matcher<br>
*Input/Output, try-with-resources<br>
*Debugging, tracing the memory leaks, exceptions etc.<br>
*Implementing ready-made small solutions (sorting algorithm, deleting 
the directory, etc.)<br>
*Change/action listeners<br>
*Combination of the above<br>
I tried to separate logic and view as much as possible, so in the future code could be used for other purposes, or new functionalities can be added.<br>

Few features were found online (I have put a source of downloaded features in the code) so I could focus on the main purpose of the project rather than e.g. implementing sorting algorithm from scratches.
